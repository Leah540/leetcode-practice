    "# [2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-found-in-sentences/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sentence** is a list of **words** that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the * **maximum number** of words that appear in a single sentence*.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Input:** sentences = [\"alice and bob love leetcode\", \"i think so too\", \"this is great thanks very much\"] <br>\n",
    " **Output:** 6 <br>\n",
    " **Explanation:** \n",
    "> - The first sentence, \"alice and bob love leetcode\", has 5 words in total.\n",
    "> - The second sentence, \"i think so too\", has 4 words in total.\n",
    "> - The third sentence, \"this is great thanks very much\", has 6 words in total.\n",
    "Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.\n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Input:** sentences = [\"please wait\", \"continue to fight\", \"continue to win\"] <br>\n",
    " **Output:** 3 <br>\n",
    " **Explanation:** It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words.  <br>\n",
    " In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.\n",

    "- `1 <= sentences.length <= 100`\n",
    "- `1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100`\n",
    "- `sentences[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters and `' '` only.\n",
    "- `sentences[i]` does not have leading or trailing spaces.\n",
    "- All the words in `sentences[i]` are separated by a single space."
